# Full-Stack Ground Curriculum


## Overview

Welcome to the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp! The repository houses the Ground curriculum and is divided into two pillars:

* student-facing **Class Content**

* instructor-facing **Lesson Plans**. 


### Class Content

You'll all activity files, Challenge instructions, starter code, and solution code, and weekly algorithms in [01-Class-Content](01-Class-Content).

Use these materials to build your class repository.


### Lesson Plans

You'll find grading rubrics, links to slide decks, and lesson plans organized by delivery format in [02-Lesson-Plans](02-Lesson-Plans). 

üìù These materials are _not_ to be shared with students.
