# Module 09 & 10 Instructor Overview: Node.js and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview

In Module 09, you will introduce students to Node.js and the concepts of standard libraries, modules, npm, and `package.json` files.

In Module 10, you will cover some crucial object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including constructors, prototypes, ES6 classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. You will also introduce students to test-driven development (TDD) and unit tests. Lastly, you will review Promises, including Promise state, Promise chaining, and the `.catch()` method.

Review the Roadmap for each module in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and the Challenges for these modules.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* The transition from client-side development to Node.js can be challenging for students. This lesson plan is a gentle introduction to the fundamentals.

* If students question why they are learning Node.js, emphasize its role in the client-server model. Full-stack developers must be able to build applications using the client-server model, and they will likely face interview questions about the difference between the client and the server and how they relate to each other.

* Ensure that students have already installed Node.js on their computers before coming to class.

  * Direct students to the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

* Many students will benefit from more information about prototypal inheritance. Try to provide supplementary resources, but avoid spending too much in-class time on the subject if some students seem to be struggling.

* You will cover polymorphism in this module, primarily focusing on **method overriding**. Be sure to review this topic and familiarize yourself with method overriding before class.

* Warn your students that this module is concept-heavy and that OOP can be difficult to understand, but it is crucial to becoming employer-competitive. Reassure them that many new developers struggle with OOP and that confusion is normal at first.

* Similarly, do not feel discouraged if your students still do not understand the concept after you have explained it. Keep encouraging and reassuring them that they will understand it with time and practice. If you are comfortable doing so, you can share your experience learning and working with OOP.

* You will also spend a day practicing TDD. Familiarize yourself with Jest if you've never used it before. Students have limited exposure to testing, so emphasize its importance and benefits. Remind students that they will eventually grasp the syntax, just like with other libraries.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

* In Module 11, we will explore the use of servers and Express.js on the back end of an application.

* We will introduce students to Express.js and server-side routes. To test these routes, students will use an app called Insomnia. Be sure to have Insomnia installed on your computer before class. To install, visit the [Insomnia installation page](https://insomnia.rest/download).

* Students will also start using Heroku to host their web applications in the next module. Be sure to install the Heroku CLI on your computer before class. For extra guidance, you can follow the [Heroku CLI installation guide on the Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/how-to-install-the-heroku-cli).

* In Module 12, students will work with MySQL databases. They will need to install MySQL Server on their machine prior to class. Be sure to provide students with the MySQL installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog by the end of this module to minimize installation time next module.
