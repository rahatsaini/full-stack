# 05.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: jQuery UI and Day.js

## Overview

In today's class, students will implement jQuery UI&mdash;specifically widgets and interactions&mdash;to make a webpage more user-friendly. Students will also learn about formatting dates using Day.js. Also, `git revert` will be covered today as a part of the continuing education on Git. And finally, students will work on a project tracker mini-project at the end of class.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_jQuery-UI-Widgets` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students might have.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module, for those who want to further their knowledge.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line by line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to do the following:

* Use jQuery UI widgets to make the webpage more user-friendly.

* Implement jQuery UI interactions to create sortable lists.

* Use Day.js to calculate time differences.

* Apply the inverse of a commit by using `git revert`.

* Collaborate with teammates to create a project tracker app.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * You will work on creating this project tracker after the break, but let's take a sneak peak at some cool features here!

  * When we click on Add Project, a modal opens up. When we click on the calendar icon within the Due Date field, we see a calendar that pops up, which makes it easier for the user to choose a date.

  * Day.js is used for date formatting. We will learn more this tool in this module!

### 2. Instructor Demo: jQuery UI Widgets (5 min)

* Open the [jQuery UI documentation on dialog](https://jqueryui.com/dialog/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë jQuery UI offers a combination of interactions, effects, widgets, utilities, and themes designed to work well together or on their own.

  * üîë The dialog widget is a basic dialog window that opens on top of a page and can be moved, resized, and closed. We can use it to display instructions or announcements on a page.

  * üîë We can click "view source" to see the code for the widget.

* Open `21-Ins_jQuery-UI-Widgets/dialog-docs.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Here we see the code for the dialog widget directly copied from the jQuery UI documentation. Let's go through the code and tweak it a bit.

  * We see the jQuery UI `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section:

    ```html
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"
    />
    ```

  * Next there's an imported stylesheet, but let's replace that with our own stylesheet:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" />
    ```

  * Let's also bring in Bootstrap:

    ```html
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
    ```

  * We can change the title and add custom content to the `<body>`.

  * We see the jQuery UI `<script>` tags at the end of the `<head>` section. But let's move those to the bottom, after the `</body>` tag:

    ```html
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.js"></script>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>
    <script>
      $(function () {
        $('#dialog').dialog();
      });
    </script>
    ```

* Open `21-Ins_jQuery-UI-Widgets/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * After we customize the dialog widget code, the resulting code can be seen in `index.html`.

  * Notice what the dialog function is doing&mdash;it is looking for an element with an id of `dialog` and applying the `.dialog()` to it.

  * We can leave this in the `index.html` file, or we can move it to a `script.js` file.

* Open `21-Ins_jQuery-UI-Widgets/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * After we tweak the code and customize it, here is what it looks like&mdash;we can see the Bootstrap design along with the dialog box on top.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We would need to read the jQuery UI documentation to figure out how to apply the widgets to the existing page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_jQuery-UI-Widgets/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: jQuery UI Widgets (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_jQuery-UI-Widgets/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üìñ Enhance UI with jQuery UI Widgets

Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

* As a user, I want to easily choose a skill from a list to use in the form.

* As a user, I want to easily select a date from a datepicker instead of writing it out manually.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the form input for entering a skill has an autocomplete feature added to it, to pick from a list of skills.

* It's done when the form input for entering a date has a datepicker feature added to it, to select by month and year.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the following documentation:

[jQuery UI demos](https://jqueryui.com/demos/)

## üí° Hints

* You will need to add an array of skills to use with the autocomplete widget (for example, `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `Bootstrap`, `React`, and `CSS`).

* Look for "Display month & year menus" in the list of examples on the datepicker widget page of the jQuery UI documentation.

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

* What built-in HTML feature can also help enforce a date?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer this.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: jQuery UI Widgets (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with jQuery UI widgets? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è jQuery UI `<link>` and `<script>` tags

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Autocomplete widget

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Datepicker widget

* Open `22-Stu_jQuery-UI-Widgets/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë First, we bring in the jQuery UI `<link>` tag and put it in the `<head>`:

    ```html
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"
    />
    ```

  * üîë We also bring in the jQuery UI `<script>` tag and put it below the `</body>`:

    ```html
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>
    ```

  * Notice that we are using a separate file for the JavaScript. Let's open that now.

* Open `22-Stu_jQuery-UI-Widgets/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We see functions for printing the skills onto the page and handling the form submit.

  * üîë If we look at the [jQuery UI documentation on autocomplete](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/), we see that we need to create an array for the `.autocomplete()` function to find and select from. Everyone's array of skills will be different but will look something like the following example:

    ```js
    // Autocomplete widget
    $(function () {
      var skillNames = [
        'Bootstrap',
        'C',
        'C++',
        'CSS',
        'Express.js',
        'Git',
        'HTML',
        'Java',
        'JavaScript',
        'jQuery',
        'JSON',
        'MySQL',
        'Node.js',
        'NoSQL',
        'PHP',
        'Python',
        'React',
        'Ruby',
      ];
    ```

  * Then we look for the element that has an id of `skill-name` (which in this case is the `<input>` element) and apply the `.autocomplete()` function to it. It will check if what is being typed is one of the values of the `skillNames` array that we just created:

    ```js
    $('#skill-name').autocomplete({
      source: skillNames,
    });
    ```

  * üîë If we look at the [jQuery UI documentation on datepicker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/), we see that we have a lot of choices in terms of customizing it. For the purposes of this activity, we want to show the month and year in drop-downs in place of the static month/year header.

  * So we look for the ["Display month & year menus" option](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#dropdown-month-year) and apply the additional Boolean options:

    ```js
    // Datepicker widget
    $(function () {
      $('#datepicker').datepicker({
        changeMonth: true,
        changeYear: true,
      });
    });
    ```

* Open `22-Stu_jQuery-UI-Widgets/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We see a Skills Form; when we start typing a skill name, we can see it will autocomplete it for us.

  * Then when we are choosing the date, we can see that the calendar allows us to choose the month and year as a drop-down.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Can you think of other uses for the autocomplete or datepicker widgets?

  * üôã We could use the autocomplete widget for entering the state field for an address. Or we could use the datepicker widget when making an appointment.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, review the [jQuery UI demos](https:\//jqueryui.com/demos/), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: jQuery UI Interactions (5 min)

* Open the [jQuery UI documentation on sortable](https://jqueryui.com/sortable/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Interactions add basic mouse-based behaviors to any element. We can drag and drop items or sort items in a list.

  * üîë The sortable interaction allows the user to reorder elements in a list or grid using the cursor. Let's try that now!

* Open `23-Ins_jQuery_UI_Interactions/sortable-docs.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Here we see the code for the sortable interaction taken straight from the jQuery documentation. Let's go through the code and customize it.

  * Again, let's clean up the `<head>` section by changing the `<title>`, importing our own custom stylesheet, moving the `<style>` code to that stylesheet, and moving the `<script>` tags down to the bottom of the page:

    ```html
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      <!-- Changed title -->
      <title>jQuery UI Sortable</title>
      <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"
      />
      <!-- Imported our own custom stylesheet -->
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" />
    </head>
    ```

  * In the `<body>` let's make a list of skills that we will learn through this course. Can you name some skills that you look forward to learning?

    * Take answers from the students and use them in the following example:

      ```html
      <body>
        <h1>jQuery UI Interactions - Sortable</h1>
        <h2>What are you most excited to learn more about?</h2>
        <div>
          <ul id="sortable">
            <li class="ui-state-default">
              Node.js
            </li>
            <li class="ui-state-default">
              HTML
            </li>
            <li class="ui-state-default">
              MySQL
            </li>
            <li class="ui-state-default">
              Express.js
            </li>
            <li class="ui-state-default">
              NoSQL
            </li>
            <li class="ui-state-default">
              React
            </li>
            <li class="ui-state-default">
              JavaScript
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </body>
      ```

* Open `23-Ins_jQuery_UI_Interactions/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * After we customize the sortable interaction code, the resulting code can be seen in `index.html`.

  * Notice what the sortable function is doing&mdash;it is looking for an element with an id of `sortable` and applying the `.sortable()` function to it:

    ```html
    <script>
      $(function () {
        $('#sortable').sortable();
      });
    </script>
    ```

  * Again, we can leave this in the `index.html` file, or we can move it to a `script.js` file.

* Open `23-Ins_jQuery_UI_Interactions/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Here we see the list of skills that we are most excited to learn more about.

  * We can order them any way we want, by dragging them up and down the list.

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answer (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We will need to read the jQuery UI documentation to figure out how to apply the interaction we want to the existing page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_jQuery-UI-Interactions/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: jQuery UI Interactions (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_jQuery-UI-Interactions/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üìñ Implement a Sortable List with Drag and Drop

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to be able to sort my list of skills using the cursor to drag and drop them.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the list of skills can be reorganized and sorted using drag-and-drop functionality.

* It's done when a placeholder is filling empty space.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the following documentation:

[jQuery UI demos](https://jqueryui.com/demos/)

## üí° Hint

* Think about which interaction will allow a user to drag an element to a new spot on the list.

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

* Can we implement drag-and-drop functionality without jQuery?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: jQuery UI Interactions (10 min)

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with jQuery UI interactions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Sortable interaction

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `placeholder` option

* Open `24-Stu_jQuery-UI-Interactions/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * According to the [jQuery UI documentation on sortable](https://jqueryui.com/sortable), to allow the user to drag and reorder the skills listed under List of Skills, we need to use the sortable interaction.

  * üîë We look for the element that has an id of `skills-list`, which is the List of Skills that will get populated by the user, and apply the `.sortable()` function to it:

    ```js
    $(function () {
      $('#skills-list').sortable();
    });
    ```

  * üîë However, we also want to add the option of seeing the whitespace between the items shifting. According to the ["Drop placeholder" option](https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#placeholder), we can do just that:

    ```js
    $(function () {
      $('#skills-list').sortable({
        placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight',
      });
    });
    ```

* Open `24-Stu_jQuery-UI-Interactions/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We see the same Skills Form as the previous activity. Let's go ahead and add some skills to the List of Skills.

  * Now when we want to order the list, we can drag and drop the skills, and we see a yellow placeholder box underneath.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between the sortable interaction and the draggable and droppable interactions?

  * üôã The draggable interaction allows you to move an item anywhere on the screen. The droppable interaction is similar, but you need to drag the item and drop it on a target.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, review the [jQuery UI demos](https://jqueryui.com/demos/), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Day.js Format (5 min)

* Open the [Day.js documentation on format](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) in your browser and explain the following:

  * üîë We use `dayjs().format()` to format dates and times. We can format the date and time in many ways.

* Open `25-Ins_DayJS-Format/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We see questions about the date and time, and they are answered according to the current date and time.

* Open `25-Ins_DayJS-Format/index.html` in your IDE and observe the following:

  * Here we only see the questions printed to the screen. The answers were calculated in `script.js`.

* Open `25-Ins_DayJS-Format/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * First we need to create a day object for today. We will use this in all of the answers. We can do so with the following code:

    ```js
    var today = dayjs();
    ```

  * For the answer to the first question, we format the day object `today` to use `MMM D, YYYY` format:

    ```js
    var gradDate = dayjs().format('MMM D, YYYY');
    $('#1a').text(gradDate);
    ```

  * For the second question, we format `today` to say which day of the week it is using `dddd`:

    ```js
    var dayWeek = today.format("[Today is] dddd")
    $("#2a").text(dayWeek);
    ```

  * For the third question, we parse the 11/3/2020 and reformat it into `dddd, MMMM D YYYY, h:mm:ss a` format:

    ```js
    var reformatDate = dayjs('2020-11-03').format('dddd, MMMM D YYYY, h:mm:ss a');
    $('#3a').text(reformatDate);
    ```

  * Lastly, we determine what week of the year we fall on right now, and use an `if/else` statement to determine if it is odd or even. Then we print to the screen a boolean along with the current week number:

    ```js
    var beginningOfYear = dayjs('2022-01-01');
    var weekNum = today.diff(beginningOfYear, 'week');

    // Check for odd week, then assign boolean to variable
    var takeOut = weekNum % 2 === 1;

    $("#4a").text(takeOut + ", because it's currently week " + weekNum);
    ```

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We will need to read the Day.js documentation to figure out how to use Day.js to format the date and time.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_DayJS-Format/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Day.js Format (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_DayJS-Format/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üìñ Create Solutions to the Date Quiz

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to be able to view the correct answers to multiple questions about dates and time.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when every question prompt on the page is correctly answered and displayed in the correct format using Day.js.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the following documentation:

[Day.js Docs](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format)

## üí° Hints

* Refer to the official [Day.js docs on parsing](https://day.js.org/docs/en/parse/parse) to format ISO 8601 strings.

* Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code to format the date that answers the questions and assign them to the declared variable provided.

* Save often and check [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser to see your progress.

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

* How can we measure the difference between two timestamps with `Day.js`? Read the [Day.js Docs](https://day.js.org/docs/en/manipulate/manipulate) to research how this works.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 10. BREAK (10 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Day.js Format (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with Day.js? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Formatting given date

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Formatting current date

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Formatting Unix timestamp

* Open `26-Stu_DayJS-Format/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë The first two questions require us to format a given date. We parse the date that needs to be reformatted and then specify how we want to display the date. We could've used any date for the graduation date. The code will look something like the following example:

    ```js
    var gradDate = dayjs('2023-06-15').format('MMM D, YYYY');

    var weekDay = dayjs('01-01-2027', 'M-D-YYYY').format('dddd');
    ```

  * üîë The next questions require us to format the current date and time. We use `dayjs()` for the current date and time, then specify how we want to display it:

    ```js
    var time = dayjs().format('hh:mm:ss');

    var unix = dayjs().unix();
    ```

  * For the last question, we had to parse the Unix timestamp and convert it to date and time:

    ```js
    var unixFormat = dayjs.unix(1318781876).format('MMM D, YYYY, hh:mm:ss a');
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we add words other than the formatted date to be displayed on the screen?

  * üôã We can use `[]` brackets. For example, if today is Saturday, then `dayjs().format("[Today is] dddd")` will display the full string "Today is Saturday".

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Day.js Documentation](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git-Revert/README.md`.

### 12. Everyone Do: Git Revert (10 min)

* Open the [Git documentation on git revert](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert) in your browser and explain the following:

  * As you work with your teammates on projects and other collaborative assignments, there will be times when you might wish that you could undo a commit.

  * `git revert` isn't exactly an undo operation, but it will figure out how to invert the changes introduced by the commit and then append a new commit with the resulting inverse content. This way you are not losing any history, which is very important for the integrity of your revision history and for reliable collaboration with others.

  * Let's say that you are working with your classmates on a project and you are trying to fix a bug. You find out that the bug was caused by a single commit. You can use `git revert` to go fix it and commit a new snapshot.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git-Revert/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. This is a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

* If necessary, you can review the activity with students.

* Open your command line, create a new directory, `cd` into it, and initialize a Git repo there:

    ```bash
    mkdir git_revert_demo
    cd git_revert_demo
    git init .
    ```

* Open the `git_revert_demo` directory in your IDE and copy the `27-Evr_Git-Revert/script.js` file into it.

* Let students know that we are taking the `script.js` file from the jQuery UI activity.

  * Before we test out the `git revert` command, we will need to make a few commits. Let's make the initial commit as follows:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m 'initial commit'
    ```

  * Then we'll add the autocomplete widget to `script.js`:

    ```js
    // Autocomplete widget
    $(function () {
      var skillNames = [
        'Bootstrap',
        'C',
        'C++',
        'CSS',
        'Express.js',
        'Git',
        'HTML',
        'Java',
        'JavaScript',
        'jQuery',
        'JSON',
        'MySQL',
        'Node.js',
        'NoSQL',
        'PHP',
        'Python',
        'React',
        'Ruby',
      ];
      $('#skill-name').autocomplete({
        source: skillNames,
      });
    });
    ```

  * Then we commit the new code:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m 'added Autocomplete widget'
    ```

  * We'll add the datepicker widget:

    ```js
    // Datepicker widget
    $(function () {
      $('#datepicker').datepicker({
        changeMonth: true,
        changeYear: true,
      });
    });
    ```

  * We commit the new code:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m 'added Datepicker widget'
    ```

  * Lastly, we'll add the sortable interaction:

    ```js
    // Sortable interaction
    $(function () {
      $('#skills-list').sortable({
        placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight',
      });
    });
    ```

  * We commit again:

      ```bash
      git add -A
      git commit -m 'added Sortable interaction'
      ```

* Enter `git log` into your terminal to display the commit history for students.

  * üîë We see all four commits when we invoke `git log`. We can use `git revert <commit hash>` to revert back to before we made the commit that matches the commit hash.

* Copy the most recent commit hash from the log of commits in your terminal.

  * üîë Once we find the correct commit hash, we can copy the commit hash and use it in the git command, `git revert <commit hash>`. It should look something like this:

     ```bash
     git revert 601e2affb5fca3addd898cb09ef950c562338823
     ```

  * This will create a new commit, which will open the commit message editor prompting for a new commit message.

* Demonstrate to students how to `esc`, `Shift + Z`, and `Shift + Z` to exit out of the message editor.

* Open `script.js` in your IDE:

  * When we check the `script.js` file, we see that the sortable interaction is indeed gone.

* Run `git log` in your terminal and demonstrate the following:

  * We see that we have a record of all the commits in the project history.

  * üîë We can also pass in `HEAD` instead of the commit hash, which will instead revert the latest commit:

     ```bash
     git revert HEAD
     ```

  * This action creates another new commit, which will again open the commit message editor prompting for a new commit message. We can press `esc`, `Shift + Z`, and `Shift + Z` to exit out of the message editor.

* Run `git log` in your terminal and demonstrate the following:

  * When we run `git log`, we can see the automatically generated commit messages for both of our revert commands.

* Answer any questions before students go on break.

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini-Project (5 min)

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We see a header with the title "Project Tracker" with the current time and date. On the left, we see instructions for adding a project to the project tracker.

  * üîë When we click Add Project, a modal pops up and we can add the information requested.

  * üîë Once we submit that form, we see the project listed in the table.

  * üîë When we click the "x", that project is deleted from the list.

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this, working in groups of three to four?

  * üôã We will break up the different tasks amongst the group members and try to finish at least the first three tasks. We need to create an `index.html` file for the HTML and a `script.js` file for the JavaScript and jQuery. When in doubt, we can refer to the official documentation for Bootstrap, jQuery, jQueryUI, Day.js, and Google Fonts.

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini-project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini-Project (45 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `28-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

```md

# Mini-Project: Project Tracker

In this project, you will work with others to create a project tracker application using Bootstrap, jQuery, jQueryUI, Day.js, and Google Fonts. Break up these phases amongst members of your team.

## Instructions

This mini-project is divided into four tasks. The first three tasks will get you to MVP, so focus on those first!

### Task 1: HTML Build

1. Create a header/hero area that welcomes users to the application and displays the current time and date using Day.js. The current time and date should be updated every second with `setInterval()`. The data should be formatted with the abbreviated month, day, full year, and time (e.g. `Jun 30, 2022 at 08:37:48 am`).

2. Create a Bootstrap card component explaining the instructions of how to use the app and a button to open a [Bootstrap modal dialog](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/modal/).

3. The modal should contain a form asking users to fill in the following data:

  * The name of the project.

  * The type of project (use a `<select>` drop-down).

    * The date the project is due (use the `date` input type).

    * Optional: Use the jQuery UI datepicker instead of `date` input type.

4. Include a Bootstrap table that the project's information can be printed to with columns for the following data:

  * Project name

  * Project type

  * Due date

While you build, remember the following guidelines:

* Ensure that any elements you need to interact with using JavaScript/jQuery are properly identified (e.g., form elements, the table body, etc.).

* Use different `<input>` element attributes to help enforce rules, like different `type` attribute values, minimum values, and required! See the [MDN web docs on the HTML input element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) for more guidance.

* When in doubt, read the Bootstrap documentation.

---

### Task 2: Capture Form Data

1. Using jQuery, set up functionality to capture the form's input elements on submit and use that data to create a new table row on the page.

2. Select and save references to every DOM element we will interact with to a variable (i.e., `var projectFormEl = $("#project-form");`) so that we can use these elements later.

3. Attach a submit event listener to the `<form>` element using jQuery.

4. On submission, capture the input values from the form and update localStorage so that the projects that have been added are persistent. Clear the form data so that the user can easily add additional projects.

5. Call the function to print the project data on the page.

6. Ensure the modal closes when the user submits the form.

---

### Task 3: Print Project Data to Page

1. Create a function that will read the saved projects from localStorage.

2. Create a table row (`<tr>`) element and save it to a variable.

3. If the project is past due, give the row a class so that the row for the project will have a light red background. If the project is due today, give the row a class so that the row will have a light yellow background.

4. Create a table detail (`<td>`) element for each of the corresponding project fields in Task 1.

5. Append each `<td>` element to the `<tr>`.

6. Append each `<tr>` to the `<tbody>` element on the page.

7. Don't forget to clear the `<tbody>` before adding all the rows.

8. Add a call to the function when the page loads.

9. Update the function responsible for capturing form data so that it calls the function for printing the data.

---

### Task 4: Delete a Project from the Table

1. Update the table to accommodate one more column without a name.

2. When generating a new `<tr>` for a project, add one more `<td>` that holds a button for deleting a project from the list.

3. Use jQuery event delegation to attach an event listener to each of those buttons so that when clicked, the parent `<tr>` element will be removed from the page and the project is removed from localStorage. (HINT: How might using a data-* attribute be helpful?)

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini-Project (10 min)

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Bootstrap modal

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Capture form content

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Day.js time differences

  * ‚úîÔ∏è jQuery event delegation

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We don't have time to review every part of this mini-project; however, we will review the key points.

  * üîë We can find the general code for the modal in the official documentation for Bootstrap modals. In the modal, we will put in a form. Notice the id for the input fields, shown in the following example:

    ```html
        <div
      class="modal fade"
      id="new-project-modal"
      tabindex="-1"
      aria-labelledby="new-project-modal-label"
      aria-hidden="true"
    >
      <div class="modal-dialog">
        <div class="modal-content">
          <form id="project-form">
            <div class="modal-header custom-modal-header">
              <h5 class="modal-title" id="new-project-modal-label">
                Add a new project
              </h5>
              <button
                type="button"
                class="btn-close btn-close-white"
                data-bs-dismiss="modal"
                aria-label="Close"
              ></button>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
              <div class="mb-3">
                <label for="project-name-input">Project Name</label>
                <input
                  type="text"
                  id="project-name-input"
                  class="form-control"
                  placeholder="Enter the project's name"
                  required
                />
              </div>
              <div class="mb-3">
                <label for="project-type-input" class="form-label"
                  >Project Type</label
                >
                <select id="project-type-input" class="form-select">
                  <option value="Web Application (Front End)">
                    Web Application (Front End)
                  </option>
                  <option value="Web Application (Back End)">
                    Web Application (Back End)
                  </option>
                  <option value="Web Application (Full Stack)">
                    Web Application (Full Stack)
                  </option>
                  <option value="Mobile Application">Mobile Application</option>
                  <option value="Print Campaign">Print Campaign</option>

                    Digital Marketing Campaign
                  </option>
                </select>
              </div>
              <div class="mb-3">
                <label for="project-date-input">Due Date</label>
                <input
                  type="date"
                  id="project-date-input"
                  class="form-control"
                  required
                />
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-footer">
              <!--
                The data-bs-dismiss attribute tells Bootstrap to hide the <div
                class="modal-footer"> element on click.
              -->
              <button
                type="button"
                class="btn btn-outline-secondary"
                data-bs-dismiss="modal"
              >
                Cancel
              </button>
              <button
                type="submit"
                class="btn btn-custom"
                data-bs-dismiss="modal"
              >
                Add Project
              </button>
            </div>
          </form>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    ```

  * üîë We can see how we capture the form content by looking at the function for handling the form submit in `script.js`:

    ```js
    var timeDisplayEl = $('#time-display');
    var projectDisplayEl = $('#project-display');
    var projectFormEl = $('#project-form');
    var projectNameInputEl = $('#project-name-input');
    var projectTypeInputEl = $('#project-type-input');
    var projectDateInputEl = $('#project-date-input');

    function handleProjectFormSubmit(event) {
      event.preventDefault();

      // read user input from the form
      var projectName = projectNameInputEl.val().trim();
      var projectType = projectTypeInputEl.val(); // don't need to trim select input
      var projectDate = projectDateInputEl.val(); // yyyy-mm-dd format

      var newProject = {
        name: projectName,
        type: projectType,
        date: projectDate,
      };

      // add project to local storage
      var projects = readProjectsFromStorage();
      projects.push(newProject);
      saveProjectsToStorage(projects);

      // print project data
      printProjectData();

      // clear the form inputs
      projectNameInputEl.val('');
      projectTypeInputEl.val('');
      projectDateInputEl.val('');
    }

    ```

  * üîë We use Day.js to format the time and calculate the difference between now and the due date:

    ```js
    function displayTime() {
      var rightNow = dayjs().format('MMM DD, YYYY [at] hh:mm:ss a');
      timeDisplayEl.text(rightNow);
    }

    ```

  * üîë And finally, in Task 4, when we delete a project from the table, we are attaching an event listener to a button for each `<tr>`. When it is clicked, that `<tr>` element will be removed from the page:

    ```js
    // Removes a project from local storage and prints the project data
    function handleDeleteProject() {
      var projectIndex = parseInt($(this).attr('data-index'));
      var projects = readProjectsFromStorage();
      // remove project from the array
      projects.splice(projectIndex, 1);
      saveProjectsToStorage(projects);

      // print projects
      printProjectData();
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How are we printing the time to the page every second in the header?

  * üôã We are using `setInterval()` to call the function `displayTime()`, which uses Day.js to format the current time and appends it to the page, every second.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on the HTML input element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) or the [Bootstrap documentation on components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/modal/), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Instructor Demo: Introduce Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We see a daily planner with the current day displayed on top and a calendar with timeblocks.

  * Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether that hour is in the past, present, or future, according to the current time.

  * When we click on a timeblock, we can add an event and press Save.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning to use HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. We are also using Day.js to work with the date and time.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã It is using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, as well as the newly learned Day.js library and Bootstrap.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã We are creating interactive webpages that are dynamically updated using JavaScript. We are also learning to use different libraries that enhance the quality of our web apps.

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Challenge Requirements found in `02-Challenge/README.md`.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
