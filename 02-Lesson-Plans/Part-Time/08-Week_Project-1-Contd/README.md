# Module 08 Instructor Overview: Project 1

## Overview

In this module, students will continue to work on their projects and will present them to the class at the end of the module. They'll also update their professional materials, including their portfolio, GitHub profile, resume, and LinkedIn profile.

Review this module's Roadmap in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and this module's group project.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* **Important**: This week, students will receive an email providing 12 months access to the GitHub Student Developer Pack, providing them with $13 in free Heroku credits each month, which they'll need to complete several of the Challenge assignments and projects in the second half of the course. Let them know that once they receive the email, they should ensure that they're logged into their GitHub account before clicking on the link in the email to activate their access to the Student Developer Pack.

	* They'll learn how to [connect the Student Developer Pack to Heroku](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/how-to-install-the-heroku-cli#connect-your-heroku-account-to-github) when they install Heroku in Module 11, but they should accept the invitation now to ensure that you're ready for the rest of the course.

* Encourage students to spend time deciding how they want to present their project before presentation day.

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) with students early in the week to give them ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Students must have a deployed project by presentation day, so encourage students to work on deploying their projects by the class prior to presentation day at the latest. Since you can always update deployed projects, it is recommended that students deploy early on and update their live version with every new feature.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

* Before the next module, make sure you install Node.js on your machine. Refer to the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

> **Important**: Because some of the technologies we use in this course like GraphQL and MERN do not work well with Node 18, we will roll back to Node 16. Once these problems have been resolved, using Node v18 will be fine. Follow this [link to our blog on how to install Node.](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

* Also, make sure students have it installed prior to starting Module 09.
